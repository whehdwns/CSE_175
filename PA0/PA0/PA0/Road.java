// Road
//
// This class implements a segment of road directly connecting two nearby
// locations on a map.  Thus, Road objects form the "links" between location
// "states", and the collection of all Road objects leading out of a given
// location provides the result of the "successor function" for that "state".
// Each road segment has a name.  While it would be nice if these road names
// were unique, there is nothing in this or related classes that depends on
// road names being unique identifiers.  (This is unlike Location names, which
// must be unique.)  Each Road also maintains the names of "from" and "to" 
// locations, as well as references to the actual Location objects 
// corresponding to those locations.  (Note that this is slightly redundant,
// as the Location objects know their own names, but this redundancy makes
// the reading of maps from files a little easier.)  Lastly, each Road object
// has an incremental path cost:  the cost, in either time or distance, of
// traversing this road segment.
