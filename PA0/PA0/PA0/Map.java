//
// Map
//
// This class implements a simple street map for the purposes of shortest-path
// search.  It makes use of Location objects to encode specific locations on
// the map and Road objects to encode direct connections between locations.
// These maps are designed to be read from simple text files.  In particular,
// two files are needed to specify a map:  a location file and a road file.
// The location file contains a list of all locations on the map, with one
// location per line.  The road file contains a list of all road segments on
// the map, with one road segment per line.  The pathnames of these two files
// are stored in the Map object, so the files can be specified in advance of
// their being read and parsed.  The map is stored as a collection of 
// Location objects, with each Location being given the responsibility of
// maintaining all of the Road objects corresponding to road segments leading
// out of it.
