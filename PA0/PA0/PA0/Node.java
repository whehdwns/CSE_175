// Node
//
// This class implements a node in a search tree being constructed to find
// a shortest path from one location to another on a map. Each node includes
// a reference to the corresponding location "state", a reference to its 
// parent in the search tree (i.e., the "parent" node), and a collection
// of children nodes which remains empty until the node is expanded. Each
// Node object also records the depth of the node in the search tree and
// the partial path cost from the initial node in the search tree to
// this one. This class provides two noteworthy methods. First, the
// "expand" method fills in the "children" list of this node, using
// information embedded in this node's Location object. Second, the
// "reportSolution" recursive method uses the "parent" references of
// nodes in the search tree in order to output the path from the
// initial node of the search tree to this node.
